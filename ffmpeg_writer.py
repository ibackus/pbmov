class FFMPEG_VideoWriter:
    """ A class for FFMPEG-based video writing.

    A class to write videos using ffmpeg. ffmpeg will write in a large
    choice of formats.

    Parameters
    -----------

    filename
      Any filename like 'video.mp4' etc. but if you want to avoid
      complications it is recommended to use the generic extension
      '.avi' for all your videos.

    size
      Size (width,height) of the output video in pixels.

    fps
      Frames per second in the output video file.

    codec
      FFMPEG codec. It seems that in terms of quality the hierarchy is
      'rawvideo' = 'png' > 'mpeg4' > 'libx264'
      'png' manages the same lossless quality as 'rawvideo' but yields
      smaller files. Type ``ffmpeg -codecs`` in a terminal to get a list
      of accepted codecs.

      Note for default 'libx264': by default the pixel format yuv420p
      is used. If the video dimensions are not both even (e.g. 720x405)
      another pixel format is used, and this can cause problem in some
      video readers.

    audiofile
      Optional: The name of an audio file that will be incorporated
      to the video.

    preset
      Sets the time that FFMPEG will take to compress the video. The slower,
      the better the compression rate. Possibilities are: ultrafast,superfast,
      veryfast, faster, fast, medium (default), slow, slower, veryslow,
      placebo.

    bitrate
      Only relevant for codecs which accept a bitrate. "5000k" offers
      nice results in general.

    withmask
      Boolean. Set to ``True`` if there is a mask in the video to be
      encoded.
    
    quality
      int, used to set the quality of the video for certain codecs
      for libx264 (default) on a logarithmic scale 0-51, 0 being lossless.
      Default is 23.  18 should be nearly lossless
      
    ffmpeg_params
      list of strings.  Additional command line parameters to pass to ffmpeg,
      e.g. : ['-threads', '1']
